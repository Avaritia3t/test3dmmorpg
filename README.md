Introductory version of 3d mmorpg.

The central story premise will resolve a strategic, combat, 'lifestyle' mmorpg based around fantasy elements applied to a strategic game faction and player alliance combat and resource-driven interpersonal gameplay setting that encourages users to learn mechanics, invest time and resources, and cultivate ongoing knowledge and engagement with an emphasis on satisfaction and engagement.

Initial versions will be rendered as 3D maps with unique terrain and territory elements that provide the basis for player-vs-player (PvP) and player-vs-environment (PvE) gameplay elements. Mechanics will be built out in full to allow environment properties, player properties, non-player-character (NPC) properties, and simple combat mechanics. From there, development will progress to PvP combat elements with a simulated enemy combatant before live, server-driven combat is implemented - this will be a long-term release goal.

Following the implementation of simple player-vs-X (PvX) functionality, mechanics will be built to support non-combat growth avenues to encompass a larger variety of gameplay. There will ultimately be implementation of reputation, trade, and resource-consumption pathways, questing pathways, and player-driven eventhoods that drive game growth into the future.
